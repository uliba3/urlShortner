# urlShortner

## Project Description

CS 230
Fall 24
Dr. Musgrave
In-Class Project
In a group of 2-3 people, build an application to store URL’s of any length and return a
shortened version of the URL in Python. Entering the shortened URL will return the full
URL. Your project should protect against invalid URL’s. The format of the shortened
URL should have a unique id that is less than 12 ASCII characters. You should decide
on a way to store the data, and this can be in a file with a specified format (CSV, JSON).
You should be able to count the number of URL’s that have been shortened so far. You
can accept user input as text given a prompt. If you feel comfortable with more
advanced methods, you can do that as well.
A valid URL looks like: “https://www.google.com/home?userId=12345&profile=abcdef”
A shortened URL could look something like: “https://myApp.com/short123”
Consider what happens as the application grows in size. What data structures and
algorithms will need to be used? There may be other application performance issues to
consider. Is there a limit to the number of URL’s that can be stored?
Decide on the number of application features that you can complete within the
timeframe.
After you have finished development, prepare a demo of your application to the class.
